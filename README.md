In this web app I have created a job portal where user can accept and reject the candidates
from the candidates list.

API used for getting candidate data: http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/he-public-data/users49b8675.json

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
